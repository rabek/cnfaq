        Two or more nodes are needed in order to form a network connection.
        
12.  What are routers?
Ans.    Routers can connect two or more network segments. These are intelligent network devices that store information 
        in its routing table such as paths, hops and bottlenecks. 
        With this info, they are able to determine the best path for data transfer. Routers operate at the OSI Network Layer.
